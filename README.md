# Beam Over Rests
A plugin for MuseScore that beams over rests, following preset rules.
This plugin is still in a primitive testing stage, and is missing many key features.
Please read [the plugin's wiki](https://github.com/XiaoMigros/beam-over-rests/wiki) to get the most out of it, and to avoid crashes.

## Features
 - Beam over Rests in a score, according to preset rules
 - Beam over the whole score, or just a selection
 - Beam over tuplet rests, and simplify tuplet optics when appropriate

### Upcoming Features (by v1.0, presumably)
- A simple settings window, allowing for customisation
- Make your own presets for different time signatures
- An option to beam over everything in a measure
- More presets bundled in
- Various bug fixes
- More legible code structure

### Later release(s):
- Overhaul of settings window: Proper GUI, apply score-specific settings
- Addition of complex time signatures
- Autoadjustment of rest + beam positions
- Option to rebeam all notes as well as rests

## Installation
Download and move 'Beam Over Rests.qml' to MuseScore's plugins folder.
Currently MuseScore 4 does not detect the plugin.
