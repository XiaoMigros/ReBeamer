## Installation
Download all the files, unzip them and move them to MuseScore's plugins folder.

For more help installing this plugin, visit [this page](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/3/plugins#installation).

## Usage

Run the plugin from the bottom of the 'Tools' tab, or assign a shortcut to it in the Plugin Manager. The plugin will detect if there is a selection and apply itself accordingly (note: it will always apply itself to whole measures). MuseScore's Undo/Redo commands work as usual.

If the plugin crashes, an error message will appear at the end of the score.

### Optimisation
Here are some things you can do to avoid issues with the plugin:
* Regroup rhythms: The plugin works best when all of your sheet's rhythms are notated correctly. If you know what you're doing, great! If you don't, run 'Tools/Regroup Rhythms' before running the plugin.
* 2nd+ Voices: The plugin might not work correctly if there are any deleted rests in voices 2-4. If you don't want a rest to be seen, make it invisible instead.

### Customisation
To create your own custom rules, see ['presets/timesig template'](https://github.com/XiaoMigros/beam-over-rests/blob/main/presets/timesig%20template). There you can define rules for in general or for specific time signatures.
